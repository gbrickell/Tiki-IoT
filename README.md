# Tiki IoT: 'C' code for accessing the Tiki API
 The aim of this repository is to support the way the open source <a href="https://tiki.org" target="_blank" >Tiki software</a>, an all-in-one Wiki+CMS+Groupware system, can be used as a central data repository and management capability for an IoT deployment.

The schematic below provides a very generic picture of how the various components of an overall ‘Tiki IoT’ system might be deployed.

## Documentation and example code
 - the Tiki_API_C_code folder contains code to support programmable access to the Tiki API by a local 'integrating' hub device such as a Raspberry Pi;
 - the Test_code_Python_templates folder provides a series of Python scripts, as templates that can be easily configured to allow each of the API access 'C' functions to be tested; and
 - the documentation folder contains a PDF that provides some notes on the IoT context and the development/testing of the 'C' code.
