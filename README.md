# Tiki IoT: 'C' code for accessing the Tiki API
 The aim of this code and documentation maintenance repository is to support the way the open source <a href="https://tiki.org" target="_blank" >Tiki software</a>, an all-in-one Wiki+CMS+Groupware system, can be used as a central data repository and system management capability for an Internet of Things (IoT) deployment.

The schematic below provides a very generic picture of how the various components of an overall ‘Tiki IoT’ system might be deployed.

## Documentation and example code
Within this repository:
 - the Tiki_API_C_code folder contains example 'C' code to support programmable access to the Tiki API by a local IoT 'integrating' hub device such as a Raspberry Pi;
 - the Test_code_Python_templates folder provides a series of Python scripts, as templates that can be easily configured to allow each of the Tiki API access 'C' functions to be tested from an 'integrating' hub device such as a Raspberry Pi; and
 - the documentation folder contains a PDF that provides some notes on the IoT context and the development/testing of the 'C' code.
 
All the code files have a YYMMDD element in their file name which designates the release version, where the current versions are all 240403.
